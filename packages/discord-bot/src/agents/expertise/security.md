# Security Expert

## Mental Model
Accumulated expertise for security tasks.

*Total sessions: 6*

## Patterns Learned
- Separate authentication logic from business logic
- Use defense-in-depth: multiple security layers
- Principle of least privilege for all access controls
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs

## Common Pitfalls
- Storing passwords in plain text
- Using weak session tokens
- Not implementing rate limiting
- Exposing sensitive error messages to users
- Hardcoding credentials in source code

## Effective Approaches
- JWT tokens for stateless, scalable authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing (cost factor 12+)
- Key-only SSH authentication (disable password auth)
- 2FA for critical systems (TOTP/Google Authenticator)
- Fail2ban for brute force protection
