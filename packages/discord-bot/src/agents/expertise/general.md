## Patterns Learned
- Break complex tasks into smaller, verifiable steps
- Always verify state before and after changes
- Use parallel execution where dependencies allow

## Common Pitfalls
- Not checking if processes are already running before starting new ones
- Assuming file paths exist without verification
- Not handling edge cases in parsing

## Effective Approaches
- Use RSS feeds as fallback when web scraping is blocked
- Implement graceful degradation for optional features
- Log all significant actions for debugging
