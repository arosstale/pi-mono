## Patterns Learned
<!-- Performance patterns and best practices -->

## Common Pitfalls
<!-- Performance mistakes to avoid -->
- Premature optimization without profiling
- Cache invalidation issues
- Memory leaks from event listeners
- Blocking the event loop

## Effective Approaches
<!-- Approaches for performance improvement -->
- Profile before optimizing
- Measure impact with benchmarks
- Incremental improvements with A/B testing
- Load testing before production

## Caching Strategies
<!-- Learned caching techniques -->

## Profiling Techniques
<!-- Profiling and measurement approaches -->

## Bottleneck Patterns

## Performance Domain Expertise

### Profiling Approach
- Measure before optimizing
- Focus on hot paths (80/20 rule)
- Use appropriate profiling tools
- Benchmark with realistic data

### Common Optimizations
- Caching (Redis, in-memory, CDN)
- Lazy loading / code splitting
- Database query optimization
- Async/parallel processing

### Memory Management
- Avoid memory leaks (event listeners, closures)
- Pool expensive objects
- Stream large data instead of buffering
- Monitor heap usage

### Latency Reduction
- Minimize network round trips
- Use edge computing where appropriate
- Compress responses (gzip, brotli)
- Optimize critical rendering path
